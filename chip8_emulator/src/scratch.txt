[] Put sprite drawing additions under test:
    [X] OpCodeFactory
    [X] Display

[X] Put display in machine state


[ ] set VF correctly -> only if a pixel actually changes
    [X] pixel was not set and needs to be set
    [ ] pixel was set and needs to be cleared


Display: draw only if VF is set


Pixel size depends on display width/height

Clean up OpCodeDXYNTest

Clean up MachineState

Cache already created op codes in factory?

Convenience method Memory.setOpCode(0x200, 0xD123)

Display throws error if x/y out of bounds in setPixel
